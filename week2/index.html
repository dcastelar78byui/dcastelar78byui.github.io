            <p>The screenshot is from of the CocaCola Argentina website. Coca Cola is currently promoting the new Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker movie. On the Coca Cola site we can see 2 contrasts. The Coca Cola logo with the dark background and the images of starwars, the dark side and the light side. Another advantage that cocacola has in contrast is that its logo being red and its main drink very dark, will always be successful by combining both. </p>
